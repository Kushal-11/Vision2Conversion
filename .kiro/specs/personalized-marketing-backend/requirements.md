# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Python-based backend system that generates personalized marketing emails and vision boards for users based on their purchase history and interests. The system uses a knowledge graph to understand user preferences and relationships between products, interests, and behaviors to deliver highly targeted marketing content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a marketing team member, I want to store and analyze user purchase history and interests, so that I can understand customer preferences and behaviors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's purchase data is submitted THEN the system SHALL store the purchase information with timestamps and product details
2. WHEN user interest data is provided THEN the system SHALL categorize and store interests with relevance scores
3. WHEN user data is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain historical records for trend analysis
4. IF duplicate purchase records are submitted THEN the system SHALL prevent data duplication while preserving data integrity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to build and maintain a knowledge graph of user relationships and interests, so that I can identify patterns and connections between users, products, and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new user data is processed THEN the system SHALL create or update nodes and relationships in the knowledge graph
2. WHEN analyzing user interests THEN the system SHALL identify connections between similar users and products
3. WHEN the knowledge graph is queried THEN the system SHALL return relevant relationships within 2 seconds
4. IF the knowledge graph becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide data recovery mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a marketing automation system, I want to generate personalized marketing emails based on user profiles and knowledge graph insights, so that I can deliver relevant content to each user.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a marketing email is requested for a user THEN the system SHALL analyze their profile using the knowledge graph
2. WHEN generating email content THEN the system SHALL include personalized product recommendations based on purchase history and interests
3. WHEN creating email templates THEN the system SHALL support dynamic content insertion based on user data
4. IF insufficient user data exists THEN the system SHALL generate generic but relevant content based on available information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive a personalized vision board that visualizes my interests and recommended products, so that I can discover new items that match my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a vision board is requested THEN the system SHALL generate a visual representation of user interests and recommendations
2. WHEN creating the vision board THEN the system SHALL include product images, interest categories, and personalized suggestions
3. WHEN the vision board is generated THEN the system SHALL provide structured data that can be consumed by frontend applications
4. IF vision board generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback content and error logging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to integrate with the backend through well-defined APIs, so that I can build user interfaces that consume the personalized marketing data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API receives requests THEN the system SHALL respond with properly formatted JSON data
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL authenticate and authorize requests appropriately
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return meaningful error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes
4. IF the API is under heavy load THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and graceful degradation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to be scalable and maintainable, so that it can handle growing user bases and be easily deployed and monitored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL support containerized deployment with Docker
2. WHEN monitoring the system THEN it SHALL provide health checks and performance metrics
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling of API services
4. IF system errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
